                                                                                    OVERVIEW OF PROGRAM
This program demonstrates a temperature conversion tool written in C that takes input from the user in degrees Celsius and converts it to degrees Fahrenheit. It is an introductory-level program that highlights the following key features of C programming:

Key Features:

	1.	Input Handling:
	•	Uses the scanf function to accept user input for temperature in Celsius.
	2.	Arithmetic Operation:
	•	Implements the conversion formula:

\text{Fahrenheit} = (\text{Celsius} \times \frac{9}{5}) + 32

	3.	Formatted Output:
	•	Outputs the result using printf, ensuring the values are displayed with two decimal places.
	4.	Modular Design:
	•	Divides functionality into clear steps: input, calculation, and output.
	5.	Efficiency and Simplicity:
	•	The program is concise and performs the task in a straightforward manner, suitable for beginners learning C.

Applications:

	•	This program is useful for scientific or educational purposes, where quick temperature conversions are needed.
	•	It serves as an excellent learning example for understanding basic programming concepts like variable declaration, arithmetic operations, and user interaction in C.

This program can also be easily extended or modified, for instance, by adding support for Fahrenheit-to-Celsius conversion or using loops to handle multiple conversions in one execution.
